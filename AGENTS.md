## 0. Scope & Usage

This profile should be applied **selectively** depending on project context.

### Applicable Scenarios (opt-in per project)

* [x] Rapid PoC / demo
* [x] Production backend / infra
* [ ] LLM agent / workflow / tool-calling systems
* [ ] Research code (papers, experiments)
* [ ] To-B delivery / long-term maintainability

> **Explicitly excluded by default**: Crypto / on-chain / protocol-level development.

---

## 1. Role Expectation for LLMs

LLMs are expected to:

* Act as a **generalist engineer + collaborator**, doing as much as possible *within their competence*.
* Proactively help with implementation, refactoring, testing, documentation, and design trade-offs.
* **Avoid overreaching** into areas where correctness cannot be reasonably guaranteed.

### Guardrail

If a task risks exceeding current LLM capability:

* Slow down
* Surface uncertainty
* Prefer conservative, explicit solutions

---

## 2. Strong Dislikes (Priority Ordered)

From *most unacceptable* to *least unacceptable*:

1. ❌ Uncontrollable magic / implicit behavior
2. ❌ Over-planning or premature future-proofing
3. ❌ Pattern-driven abstraction without pressure
4. ❌ Type-safety at the cost of readability
5. ❌ Code that looks advanced but adds no value
6. ⚠️ Ignoring future extensibility (acceptable in fast paths)

**General rule**: If something is implicit, magical, or clever, it must justify itself loudly.

---

## 3. Engineering Philosophy

### 3.1 Typing / Types

* Strongly pro-typing (including advanced type-level techniques).
* Type systems are **tools for clarity**, not ceremony.
* Prefer:

  * Clear type names
  * Clear variable names
  * Sufficient comments / docs
* **Strong preference** to separate:

  * Type declarations / schemas
  * Business logic implementation

### 3.2 FP vs OOP

* Default to **functional / data-oriented design**.
* OOP is tolerated only when it clearly improves:

  * State encapsulation
  * Interface clarity
* Avoid inheritance-heavy designs.

### 3.3 Config / Env / DI

* Configuration strategy:

  * `config files + env vars` are sufficient in most cases.
* Heavy config management systems are:

  * Late-stage optimizations
  * Often organizational rather than technical needs

#### Dependency Injection

* External DI is acceptable **only if** accompanied by:

  * Clear documentation
  * Setup scripts
  * Explicit dependency contracts
* Undocumented DI = broken delivery
* If DI degrades understandability, **do not DI**.

---

## 4. Delivery Bias

### 4.1 One-off / Disposable Code

* High tolerance for one-off code **if**:

  * It accelerates output
  * TODOs and intent are clearly documented
* Rewrite is preferred over premature generalization.

### 4.2 Startup vs Crypto Risk Appetite

**Startup context**:

* Speed of iteration > architectural purity
* Prefer visible progress and fast feedback

### 4.3 Dependency Management
* Prefer intro-grade SDKs or starter kits from established vendors (Big Company or 10k+ ⭐ OSS) over bespoke scaffolding.

**Crypto context**:

* Stability > speed
* Avoid financial risk
* Algorithm engineers should not casually touch contract-critical logic

---

## 5. Testing Philosophy

* Tests are cheap because AI writes them.
* Prefer **high coverage** over artisanal test design.
* Tests serve as:

  * Regression safety net
  * Executable documentation

---

## 6. LLM / Agent System Thinking

### 6.1 Primary Orientation

Priority order:

1. **System-centric** (architecture, orchestration, failure modes)
2. Prompt-centric
3. Data-centric
4. Model-centric (ML tricks, math, architectures)

### 6.2 Evaluation & Metrics

* In professional settings:

  * Eval is necessary (organizational / political reality)
* In personal projects:

  * Offline metrics are distrusted
  * First-hand experience > dashboards

> Assumption: modern LLMs tend to reward-hack and overfit evaluation signals.

### 6.3 Failure Handling

Preferred behavior:

1. Retry (with logging)
2. Expose failure clearly

Hard constraint:

* ❌ Silent failure is unacceptable
* All failures must produce actionable logs

---

## 7. When in Doubt, Default To

* Explicit data flow over clever control flow
* Simpler solutions with visible trade-offs
* Leaving TODOs with rationale rather than over-engineering
* Making uncertainty explicit

---

## 8. Collaboration Methodology
* Refer to Plan.md for task breakdown and tracking. But you shouldn't edit Plan.md directly. Only authorized project manager should do that. You can suggest changes to Plan.md.
* Refer to agent_log/ for implementation history and execution log. You may append new logs in the current .md file as needed, following existing format. But do not edit previous logs or create new log files.
    * Treat agent_log updates as part of the “definition of done,” not an optional afterthought.
* To help future code base readers run, update README.md about:
    * how codebase organized
    * how the overall system architected (if applicable)
    * how to run / test / bundle the project (if applicable) whenever you make changes that affect those aspects.
* When learn some new knowledge that is not specific to the current project but can be useful for future projects, please write it down in MEMORY.md

* Use Codex for code, VSCode / Github Copilot for code review. Keep athlete and judge roles separate.

* Be aware that localhost is not always usable in Codex sandbox. If you encounter `Operation not permitted` errors, try rerunning with escalated permissions instead of assuming the service is down.

* Task Kick-off Prompt:
    * Hi codex, please refer to AGENTS.md and all the git staged changes. then repeat your task to me. raise any question to me.
